# Interactive Full Stack Project: Sole Intentions E-Commerce

## User Story
```
AS A sneaker lover
I WANT an accessible and intuitive website where I can purchase highly sought after sneakers
SO THAT I can have easy access to purchase the rare shoes that I love
```

## Description
For this project we decided to create a full stack E-Commerce sneaker shop called Sole Intentions. Here at Sole Intentions we have become your “one-stop-shop” for all of your sneaker needs. We understand that frustration of trying to buy highly sought after shoes and not being able to get them because they sell out faster than you can click a button. We bring those shoes to you with steady availability and the ease of purchasing. We have very high stock in every shoe so you never have to worry about seeing a “sold out” message ever again.
